Introduction</a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Welcome, the following information will
explain in detail how to claim land and property legally.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The UK Land Registry currently holds
details of around 21 million registered land plots and properties; in effect
itâs a massive database of property ownership guaranteed by the land registry
itself.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In simple terms, this leaves an estimated 7
million unregistered land plot and properties in the UK right now with a
combined value of billions of Â£âs.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This is not to say all 7 million can easily
be claimed â¦ But taking into account the size of the figures involved here, the
likelihood of finding several plots of land and properties that you could claim
is very good indeed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">According to the Empty Homes Agency there
are approximately 900,000 empty homes in Britain of which nearly 800,000 are in
London. A sizeable proportion of these are abandoned or derelict.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These properties, few of which have
traceable owners, are just the type that after carrying out all proper research
you may be able to claim from using this guide.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These properties will of course at some
time have had an owner. It may be that the owner has simply never registered
his or her titleâ¦</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">However it could also be that the owner has
died and left no will and has no relatives or that the owner has never moved
away from the area many years ago effectively abandoning the property.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These then briefly are some of the types of
property and the plots. Which by the following the detailed guidelines within
this guide, you could claim as your own via the legal vehicle of adverse
possession. We will cover all these points in much more detail later.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Another interesting point worthy of
mentioning here is the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors figure of over
17,000 plots of land and property that are being illegally claimed every year
or around 250 per week.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Not all of these would be claims of the
scale and type we are going to consider in this guide. However this did lead
Charles Harpum of the Law Commission (who helped draft the recent Land
registration Act 2002) to recently comment that people claiming land and
property had become something of a ânational pastimeâ.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The legal definition of adverse possession
is as follows.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">âThe gaining of title real estate is
continuous hostile, open, and notorious possession over a statutory periodâ.
Again weâll cover the content of this definition in further detail, as we
progress.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Initially, the land plots and properties
youâll be looking for could be run down or abandonedâ¦Derelict farmhouses or
disowned buildingsâ¦</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Properties accessed via an overgrown
driveway &amp; rusty gates â¦ Fields, hidden plots of landâ¦. Even old terraced
or detached houses.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">BUT WHERE DO
YOU START?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Please read on and I will explain in full
following the pages of this guide.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the first instance I would suggest you
obtain the following from the land Registry.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These booklets and many other can be
instantly downloaded free of charge from the main web site at....... <a href="http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/">http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/ </a>&nbsp;or by clicking directly on the links below if
you have an open Internet connection.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These documents are in PDF format and you
will need Adobe Acrobat to view. If you do not already have this it is
available as a free download from <a href="http://www.adobe.com./">http://www.adobe.com./</a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Public Guide a guide to the information we
keep âand how you can obtain it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At <a href="http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/public/forms">http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/public/forms</a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This very informational booklet contains
further information regarding the land registry, a few sample forms together
with an overview of the services, and facilities the land Registry offers.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Practice guide âAdverse possession of
unregistered Land and transitional provisions for registered land in the land
registration act 2002 <a href="http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/public/property-ownership">http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/public/property-ownership</a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If you prefer you can also request the Land
Registry HQ in London to post you out the above booklets</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Further items that you will also find
extremely useful to obtain at some point in the future are the ordinance survey
map for your area of search, and the ordnance survey interactive atlas double
cdârom set which provides full in depth map coverage and analysis of the whole
of the UK and can really help in the pinpointing and research of potential
targets of land and property.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You will refer to both of these for years
to come and they are available from ordnance survey website and/or from your
local stationers/bookshop. The CD is often also available on eBay for sale for
a greatly reduced price. Just type interactive atlas into the eBay search page.
We will come back to this in more detail later in the guide.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Another very useful free research tool
(many other sites charge for this information) that can be used to find the
recent prices of any properties that have been sold in any street in the UK can
be found at <a href="http://www.nethouseprices.com/">www.nethouseprices.com</a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Click on this now and type in your postcode
to get an idea how it works.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A complete list of all forms referred to in
this guide is available at the land Registry <a href="http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/public/forms">http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/public/forms</a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Throughout this guide we have presented
direct click able links to all the forms you will need as well as providing a
complete list on the final page.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Note: links can eventually change and
become invalid as websites get revamped etc so itâs always a good idea to print
out any useful information you find for the future.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">There is also a separate and new site
recently made available by the land registry at <a href="http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/public/property-ownership">http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/public/property-ownership</a>
which allows others to electronically perform property searches.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="ChapterLeft"><a name="Chapter02">2. Step 1:
Getting Started</a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Strange as it may sound the best place to
start lies on your own doorstep.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Take the time to walk around your
particular area. If you are a car owner and make regular short journeys, try walking
from time to time. It's amazing the different things you will notice ... the
things you would never see if you were driving.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Use your keen eye to spot things you never
knew existed. Does a bit of land and property you see on your journey look well
maintained?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">There's sure to be some suitable land or
property in your vicinity ... That broken down house? Derelict farmhouse An
overgrown plot of land? An abandoned property?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Keep your eyes peeled, because you never
know when the first opportunity is going to happen. It most certainly will
eventually. Watchful eye.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The best land plots and properties that are
worth considering for future claims are the ones that appear overgrown, un-kept
or unused. This type can be classified into the following categories ...</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">However, this is not an exhaustive list,
and you may wish to take time to consider any further categories which you feel
may be worthy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A: Plots of land that is empty and
overgrown with vegetation</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">B: Plots of land that are vacant and wild
flowers occur with trees and rubble.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">C: Land used by an adjacent landowner on an
unofficial basis.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">D: Empty plots, which are neither
agricultural nor arable land.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">E: Land with no evident or well defined
boundaries, which seems unkempt and vacant, together with its boundaries.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">F: Land that includes a derelict building
located on it, which appears to be weakened and in a poor state of repair.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">G: Properties/factories/buildings in poor
state of repair and vacant.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">H: A combination of every one of one or
more of the above.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Keep an open mind and use your imagination.
All information listed above should set alarm bells ringing. When searching for
suitable target properties and land plots to claim, make sure to keep in mind
the following points at all times.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Do not be too quick to assume that empty
pieces of land are owned by the local authority, electrical or water
companies.... Especially when they are located in built-up areas.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Do not automatically assume that either the
local authority or the adjacent land owners own all grassed verges.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Just because animals are pasturing a piece
of land it does not mean that it is owned or. Registered.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It may be worth looking for land that is
occasionally occupied by travelers or Gypsies, as this land may be suitable.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Do not automatically assume that land being

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Since we have located our
"prospect" we think could be suitable for claiming through adverse
possession, the next crucial stage is the making of investigations.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I can not overemphasize how crucial this
stage is and how important it is to make diligent and careful investigation to
discover as much about the site as possible, and more importantly for our
purposes whether it is registered unregistered and/or are there identifiable
and traceable owners.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Also, again please remember the fact a
property or land is unregistered is NOT definite confirmation the land or
property may be claimed or is not owned ... Every situation and circumstance
needs careful, prudent and diligent investigation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This will allow us to search electronically

and title plan to providers with further details of ownership and the extent of
the property when it come to boundaries, etc.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">We also recommend in every cases where an
on line search suggests a property is unregistered that you instruct the land

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">THE INDEX MAP is a large scale computerized

is where we can identify a postal address for out property which will be the

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Postal address is often obvious from

the land registry identify the land if we don't know the postal address, or it

form SIM and simply attach the plan and post to them. This service is without

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In these circumstances it is probably a
good idea to purchase a local ordinance survey map and have the specific land
area on the map photocopied. You can then outline the land concerned on the

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Please note</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You should consider carefully if the copy
of the register or title plan has revealed any specific rights of way, covenants
or restrictions, and/or any rights it has over surrounding properties.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These will not crop up very often but if
they do appear then you should seek clarification from a solicitor or
alternatively your local council-planning department may be of assistance.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This is due to the fact that if anybody has
a legal right of way over and/or across a significant part of the land in
question, then (according to my recent feedback) the land registry would class
your adverse possession claim as âhighly unlikelyâ.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You would of course, have to weigh the
facts of the matter, but in the majority of cases your ultimate claim for
adverse possession would not be granted.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For specific guidance in relation to this
point please consult with your solicitor in the first instance. It also goes

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Irrespective of whether your target land or
property is REGISTERED or unregistered, you must always take the necessary
steps in order to try to locate track down the actual owner.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Methods to track down and locate the owner as
follows:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Enquire with people in the immediate
vicinity as to the last owner. The last owner may have died or had no
relatives. In the case of a house, nobody may have visited it for many years.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Make some discreet enquiries at
neighbouring properties about the owner-Â­ or if any one tends to the land or
gardens etc.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Check the voting register/electoral roll
for the specific locality in question. This is usually available for inspection
at your local library or alternatively you could visit <a href="http://www.192.com/">www.192.com</a> and carry out an electronic search of
the register nationwide.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You will need to register, and there is a
charge for searching, however you can easily obtain free search credits by
completing various online questions from sponsors.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Chat to the landlord of the local public
house and bring up the land or property in general conversation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ask at the local post office whether they
recall having delivered any mail to the address in question and if so when.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ask the reactor or vicar of the local
church.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Enquire with the local garage, petrol
station newsagents, shop keeper or milkman etc.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">By asking local people, and immediate
neighbours if they know the exact whereabouts of the owner (tell them you are
trying to locate the owner with a view to buying the land or property) you
could probably get to know where he or she is... Whether or not they are
deceasedâ¦ The year or approximate year they diedâ¦ Whether or not anyone has
visited the property since they diedâ¦ Or whether they had any relations etc.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the end of the day, you really will be
amazed at the amount of detailed information you could unearth by simply
speaking to the relevant people.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Note: You can assign the task of searching
for a specific person (or a will) to a specialized company such as <a href="http://www.1stlocate.com/">www.1stlocate.com</a> although there would be a
charge for this.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now should you fail to discover any
relevant information in relation to the owner, or last known owner, or the
consensus of the opinions you receive lead you to believe the owner has in fact
died, then you will need to check this out further via your local probate
registry office to discover whether a will was made. Further information
concerning how to achieve this can be found online....... at <a href="http://www.probate.co.uk/advice/topic.asp?id=445">http://www.probate.co.uk/advice/topic.asp?id=445</a></span></p>

way around... useful links below. <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/probate">http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/probate</a>
Please note: the addresses of the local District Registries should you wish to

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">There is also a down loadable printable
âApplication for Probate Searchâ forms in pdf format available at...... <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/forms?query=Application+for+Probate+Search&amp;collection=moj-matrix-dev-forms&amp;form=simple&amp;profile=_default%20">http://www.justice.gov.uk/forms?query=Application+for+Probate+Search&amp;collection=moj-matrix-dev-forms&amp;form=simple&amp;profile=_default</a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In general, providing you have the minimum
details of the owners name, and (estimated) year of death, this check should
enable you to confirm either way, whether or not the owner has died, and if so
whether they left a will, and if the land or property in question was actually
left to anyone.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As you will note inquires can be made via
post, or by paying a personal visit to the post office.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If your inquiries at the UK probate
registry confirm that the owner has died then you may be able to stake your
claim to the land or property, as you may find that the beneficiaries have
either forgotten about the land or there are no beneficiaries...</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Or the beneficiaries cannot be traced.
Obviously this is time consuming so you will need to do you own diligence into
the beneficiaries, to see if they are in fact using the land or property.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">There are simple steps that you must take
prior to the commencement of any particular land plot or property claim via
adverse possession (is it Registered or Unregistered)â¦</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Because ideally you do not want the owner
to appear straight after you take possession of the land or property. This will
just be a total waste of time and effort....</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So do your homework.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now, armed with your newly acquired
information (or lack of information), youâll now need to assess your next move.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the owner is still living and there is a
good chance of your adverse possession claim being quickly challenged, then you
should strike this land or property off your target list and look elsewhere.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As I have stated before in this guide there
are just so many claimable land plots and properties out there.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You neednât waste your valuable time and
effort on one like this. At this point you should revert back to earlier in
this guide and start the action rolling again.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">However, if your inquiries lead you to
believe that there is no known traceable owner, or the owner is deceased, or
not left a will, or they have moved away...</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In other words, not likely the owner will
turn up at a later date, and then is time to stake your claim.</span></p>

<p class="ChapterLeft"><a name="Chapter17">17. How to
start legal process of claiming the property via adverse possession</a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">An introduction and overview of adverse
Possession:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">We have all heard that statement
"Possession is nine tenths of the law". Well this is an important
principle used on a daily basis within the land and property sector. It also
the same legal statement that will enable you to claim land or plots and
properties, virtually for free.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Also keep in mind that by
"rescuing" abandoned &amp; land plots and properties, you are in
effect performing a service to society and yourself.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Why? Because the abandoned properties
become a blight on the community. They can quickly become a haven for
undesirables, a rendezvous for drug suppliers, a danger to children, fire hazard,
and an eyesore that drags down surrounding property values.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now moving on from there....</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Generally the land Registry accepts that if
you have taken possession of a land plot (or property) for a statutory amount
of time... Currently twelve years for unregistered or ten years for registered
land/property, under the current legislation and without any objection being
raised by either the owner or a counter claimant, then when it come to
unregistered land/property ... You may ultimately become the Registered Owner
of the land or property with Possessory Freehold Title.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the case of the 10 years' continuous
adverse possession of registered land/property. Then you will be granted
transfer of title, pro- rata to the previous ownerâs title. That is to. Say if
the previous owners' title class was absolute, then you would be granted Absolute.
Title.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This, obviously, would ultimately be
decided upon following the Land Registry's attempt to contact the previous
registered owner after the ten year period had elapsed ... And without
receiving a reply back from the previous registered owner within the prescribed
time. This point is covered in further detail later within this guide.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">However here's the bottom line:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The fact that you did not buy the land or
property concerned, and you did not inherit it, makes no difference whatsoever
in the eyes of the law.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Furthermore, dependant upon the power of
your adverse possession claim, you may be able to have your current Possessory
freehold title on unregistered converted to absolute freehold title, shortly
after the statutory twelve year period, shortly after you have been registered
as the owner and been granted Possessory Freehold Title to the land.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Again, this topic we be fully covered as we
progress via this guide.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Before we get too far ahead of ourselves,
let's take a look at the way in which you should proceed in order to get your
actual adverse possession claim underway.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The next sections of this guide, namely:
'Laying claim ... The guideline and Effective statutory Period usage deal in
great detail with the various ways which you should proceed to claim your
specific land plot or property, and more importantly, the specific activities
you may and may not undertake during your statutory ten or twelve years of
occupation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The guidelines are in line with the land
Registry's current legislation, and will therefore present you with the best
possible opportunity of successfully claiming the land plot or property as your
very own and achieving your ultimate goal of being granted Absolute Title to
it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Laying claim...</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Although you are not required to submit any
forms to the land registry at this initial stage, it is good to keep some
relevant documentary evidence to backup the start date of your claim, by
following the next steps.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Draw up a basic statement along the lines
of:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Date/time</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I am commencing my claim via adverse
possession, of land/property located at ...Then the highlighted attached plans.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Have two people sign and date your
statement then file this document away for safe keeping. You may also wish to
take several photographs of the land/property in question, with yourself in the
picture. Note this can be saved for your own personal use.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">No forms needed at this stage? Why you ask?
Simple, because the land registry are not even slightly concerned about you or
your adverse possession claim until the prescribed ten year period for
registration or twelve years for unregistered property has elapsed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now after you've filed away your
documentary evidence, and with regard to initially commencing your claim and
physically finding yourself in adverse possession of the land, here's what you
should do next.</span></p>
