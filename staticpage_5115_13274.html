<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Obviously if the area is large this could
be expensive when it comes to planning permission the current law for the whole
of the UK states as follows:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You can build a fence (or a wall) around a
specific area of land, but should the fence or wall exceed two metres in
height, planning permission from the local authority will be needed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Where the frontage of the proposed fence or
wall is directly adjacent to a road or a highway, the maximum permitted height
of the fence or wall is 1 metre. The erection of any fence or wall can not be
allowed to affect visibility of road users and/or affect the visibility of any
pre-determined access point.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In summary, you can make an application for
planning permission irrespective of regardless if you. Own the land or property.
You should also check the current ruling with your local council planning
department just to make doubly sure.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">With regard to the land Registry, Adverse
possession and the important subject of fencing, the Land registry has clear
guidelines briefly detailed as follows.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"Where the land was previously open
ground, fencing is strong evidence of factual possession, but is neither
indispensable nor conclusive".</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This simply means that partitioning the
area is recommended.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Make the land looks presentable by cutting
the grass trimming the hedges and removing any rubbish etc.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Put up a gate to keep intruders out. If the
land you are claiming is used by people in the immediate vicinity as common
land or waste ground, the erecting of a fence or wall around the land area may
well be your best option. Padlock the gates also. In short, treat the property
as your own</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Let’s now have a look at what you must

adverse possession legislation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Land statutory Period Usage...</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For your land or property claim to become
successful, your usage must be...</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">\* Exclusive.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">\* Permanent.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">\* Uninterrupted.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">\* Unchallenged.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">And all of these must make an application
for the current minimum statutory period of ten years (for registered
land/property) or twelve years (for unregistered land).</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To further elaborate on these extremely
important points, please note the following three direct quotes from the
current Land Registry leaflets....</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">What is required is not an intention to own
or perhaps even an intention to acquire ownership, but an intention to possess.
This means the intention in one's name and on one's own behalf, to exclude the
world at large, including the owner with the proper appear title if he be not
himself the possessor, up until now as reasonably practicable therefore far as
the processes of the law will allow.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">No action shall be brought be anyone to
recover any land after the expiration of twelve years from the date on which
the right of action accrued to him or, if it first accrued to some individual
through whom he claims, to that person the right of action accrues therefore
the limitation period starts to operate from the start of the adverse
possession.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">An existing owner loses his land or her
ownership (whether it be of registered or unregistered land) after there has
been "uninterrupted adverse possession for the relevant period" laid
down in the limitation act 1980.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">So there you have it. Providing that during
the statutory period, ten to twelve years of your adverse possession, no person
else has proved that they are the owner and you can prove to the land registry
that you have been using or have developed use (permanently and on-going) of
the land or property for the statutory period, being granted ownership with
possessory freehold title should not be a problem...</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Or having the title transferred pro-rata to
the previous registered owner’s title, when it comes to registration land or
property.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The only exclusion to the statutory period
is relevant to crown land, where statutory period is never less than thirty
years.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">During your occupation of the land
(preceding making an application for ownership and/or transfer of title) there
are many ways whereby you can also generate an income from the land, which
consequently will go a long way to providing your permanent and on-going usage
and occupation of it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Examples.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">\* Erect sheds grow small plants,.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">\* Grow trees.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">\* Animal Grazing.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">\* Grow crops.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">\* Rent.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">\* Erect sheds.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Should you decide to profit from your land
or rent it out to an other party, I would strongly recommend you keep a record
of all weekly, monthly or quarterly payments received in lieu of goods and/or
services provided during the statutory period.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These records can then be produced as proof
to the land registry that you have been making. Use of the land for the
statutory period, when requested.</span></p>

the land</a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">After TWELVE years continuous possession of
the unregistered land, and your successful registration of ownership with
possessory Freehold title (or title transfers pro-rata to the previous
registered owners title), you will have no trouble whatsoever with building on
(or developing) the land, planning permission permitting, obviously.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Should you decide to erect a property, or
fully repair/renovate the existing property before the conclusion of the
statutory period, then any improvements you make will be conveyed to the land
owner or their relatives, should they unexpectedly appear and prove their
ownership. From personal experience, I would advise you not to build anything
on the land during statutory period.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Following granted ownership to the
unregistered land or property after statutory period, with Possessory Freehold
Title (or having the previous owner's title transferred to you when it come to
registered land or property) and so as to ultimately protect your investment,
there exists a readily available Defective title indemnity insurance policy,
which you can obtain on the land or property.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In either case this policy totally negates
the relevance of the new owner unexpectedly. Appearing at a later date. It
makes absolutely no difference to you one way or the other.</span></p>

what you should do next.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Gain entry and secure the property. This
can be done by utilizing the service of a locksmith when entering a property,
always have the locks changed if possible. Irrespective of the circumstances,
do not force entry to the property, and always be sure not to cause any actual
damage to the property in question.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If the property is in a run down state,
then you'll have to take care of this accordingly. Your ultimate objective here
is to secure the property into a position where you'll be able to physically
enter and live there, or alternatively rent the property out to a tenant.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These options are covered in detail later

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Until your claim has gone the statutory ten
or twelve years distance and you have been granted possessory Freehold title
(or had the previous owners title transferred to you) you would be unwise to
spend any great amount of money on the refurbishment.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For instance, spending thousands of pounds
on a new kitchen or bathroom might be money wasted at this very beginning in
the proceedings, as there is always a chance that the true owner could appear
at any moment during the statutory period.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Inexpensive repairs should not be a
problem, i.e. painting walls, floors, etc.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These are the options you should seriously
consider prior to deciding to enter there yourself or renting the property out.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Some properties may well only need a lick
of paint and a good tidy up, others may need more attention. You should
obviously, take these factors into account during the early stages of your
investigations into properties you could claim adverse possession.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Factors to overview and remember:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Adverse possession of the unregistered land
or property...</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">TWELVE years adverse possession ends, and
an application to become registered owner with possessory freehold title is
submitted to the land registry.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The land registry grants registered
ownership. You are now the registered owner of the. Land or property with
possessory freehold title.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">A further twelve years on from the date you
were granted possessory Freehold title, you can. Then apply towards the land
registry to have your title upgraded to Absolute Freehold title.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In summary, 24 years from the initial
commencement of your adverse possession claim. Of the unregistered land or
property, you will be the legal owner and you'll be free to do anything you
choose with your newly acquired land or property, subject to local authority
constraints such as planning, building regulations health and safety,
covenants, etc</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I would discourage selling your land within
your first TWELVE years adverse possession. You. may be able to sell your
interest during this period, but the sale price would be very low.at best.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Taking the brief overview into account would
probably lead you to believe that you must wait 24 years before being granted
Absolute Title to the land or property.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Based on the letter of the law this is
true, but in reality you could make an application for, and be granted Absolute
title long before then. Here is how.....</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Law....</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Where the title is a possessory one,
whether freehold or leasehold, the proprietor is entitled to request conversion
to either absolute freehold or good leasehold if the land has been registered
for twelve years.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Application can also be made at any time
after the land is first registered, to convert a possessory freehold to
absolute.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Which means after twelve years you can
convert to absolute? Extra 1-2 years from your claim date, before the 24 years
have elapsed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Worse case scenario is that you make an
application for conversion of title and it is rejected. There would be no harm
done, and you will have to wait the full term whilst still proceeding to
benefit from the land or property in the meantime.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Along with the above point, do not forget
that you still have the opportunity to cash in via Defective title indemnity
insurance plan, as outlined earlier within this guide.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Statutory Declaration.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This should be completed with the aid of
your solicitor, to include and cover all the relevant details applicable to
your claim, including the following information.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The circumstances through which your
adverse possession started, including specific date.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The specific purpose for which the land or

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The extent of which the land or property
has been used and the activities carried on. there.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">If there is a gate, details regarding, if
there is a lock and key, and if so, who holds the key?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The name and address of the owner or the person
thought to be the owner.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The title number and documentation of any
registered land you may own that adjoins the land or property area you are
claiming.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Confirmation that your occupation of the
land or property has not been under a lease, tenancy, licence, or with the
consent of anyone.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Full details and documentation relating to
any disputes arising from your occupation (or a tenant's occupation) of the
land or property.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The forms FR-I and DL should be brought to
a practicing land law solicitor, who will help you complete them in line with
your objective. A plan of the land area should also be affixed to form FR-I,
with the respective acreage highlighted.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Your solicitor will also be required to
sign the form and sign and witness your statutory declaration. Form DL should
also be returned to the land registry in duplicate. Two copies should be sent
together with the rest of the forms and documentation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">All this may seem a lot to absorb at a
beginning, but keep in mind this will not be needed until twelve years'
time..... Your solicitor will be knowledgeable with these forms.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Finally when it comes to the Fee for the
FR-J submission, this is based upon the value of the property. Your best option
here would be to estimate it yourself between 0 and £50,000.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Land registry fee of £40. The only
exception is if a surveyor needs to visit the site in relation to a land
dispute or court hearing, a fee will apply in this particular instance.</span></p>

their records as being the registered owner, to advise them that they have
received an official application to have the land or property registered in the
name of the new owner i.e. you.</span></p>

owner of the land or property will have a maximum of sixty five business days,
three months so as to respond to the communication and object to the
registration, if this happens then naturally your application will be rejected.</span></p>

proceeding with an adverse possession claim you should make sure to carry out
all checks.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Now if all checks out ok, you should hear
back from communication with confirmation of your registered ownership.</span></p>
